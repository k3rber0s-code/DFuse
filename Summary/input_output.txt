Input:
    - tensors (cooridinates, one-hot for every categorical)
    - fixed number of ligand atoms
    - molecules with coordinates and categorical features (type of atom etc.)
    - two types:
    - protein pocket atoms
    - ligand atoms

Output:
    - generated ligand with high affinity, to easily bind to specific pocket
    - tensors (cooridinates, one-hot for every categorical)
    - same features as in Input
